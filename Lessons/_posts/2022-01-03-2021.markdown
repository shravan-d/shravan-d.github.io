title: Lessons; 2021.

What I learned this year that I absolutely cannot forget. 

I spent my year working at Samsung; in two different cities mostly - one where I was surrounded by  my girlfriend, friends and family; and the other where my main focus was on working out and going to the office. Both these cities contributed to decisions I have made regarding how I want to live (well I believe atleast for now). 
As of this moment, I'm being lauded for the minimal work I do for my company right now with growth looming, and soon I'll be off to do my Master's degree. However the way I feel, to say bluntly, I am on a path to be highly educated, professionally successful and financially illiterate with little satisfaction or freedom.
