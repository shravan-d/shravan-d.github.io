title: Atomic Habits by James Clear.

A summary of Atomic Habits by James Clear.

> "When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stone cutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow, it will split into two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it; but all that had gone before." - Jacob Riis.

The premise of atomic habits says that positive habits, no matter how small can go a long way in helping you towards your goals. The book starts out with how these small positive habits can help you, and then gives suggestions as to how you can maintain positive habits and weed out negative ones. It urges you to search for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure, it will multiply whatever you feed it. The more bad habits you feed yourself, the farther way you stray from your goal. You have to understand that bad habits cause degradation, rather than the more easy to take assumption that you just don't grow. So the book focusses on ways to do away with such bad habits and introduce small positive habits into your daily routine. With the same habits, you'll end up with the same results; but with the aggregation of marginal gains, anything is possible.

When I think I lack motivation, maybe I just lack clarity. The author says that goals are only good for setting a direction, but once you have that all progress depends on the system. You need to adopt a system that matches your identity, that's how you can stick to it. It's hard to adopt a habit that doesn't match with your identity. I see myself as an easy going person happy with what he has, but the habits I'm trying to build are those of a try-hard. I am happy with what I have, but I want more from life and so it mkes sense for me to adopt these habits. Your habits embody your identity. When you write everyday, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athlete. The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself. I'd like to be healthy and fit so it's normal that I eat healthy and work out. In the end, you don't become the person you want to be, you become what you do about it - you become your habits.

The book breaks habits into 4 parts, in order to simplify the process of adopting good habits and breaking bad ones.

Cue, Craving, Response, Reward

# Cue
## Make it obvious.
All habits are instigated by a certain cue. A vibration from my phone leads to my bad habit of scrolling my instagram feed. Joining a meeting intigates an urge to do the day's wordle. A good way to start managing habits would be to manage the cues that lead to these habits. The idea here is to make good habits obvious, and bad habits invisible. For instance, keeping my sunscreen right next to my wallet so that I remember to use it evey time I head out, or hiding the notifications from instagram so I don't get sucked into the realm of random reels.

One good way to create a cue is to use what the author terms as implementation intention, which is to create a cue with time and a place. I will go to the gym at 6 pm. And if you are able to do this consistently, when the clock hits 6pm, your body will automatically push you to the gym. Another way is to stack habits together. After I finish my workout, I'll read my book along with eating a banana. I also have rituals to create cues for good habits; something along the lines of playing a specific song before each workout, or writing in my blog after a call with my girlfriend. 

Visual cues are the most significant. Fill your environment with cues for good habits. Prime your environment to make good habits easy and bad habits difficult. Eg. Set out your workout clothes ahead of time, unplug your tv after each view and plug it back on only after saying out loud the show you want to watch. Redesign your world so that actions that matter the most are also actions that are easiest to do. It's also important to separate the context for good and bad habits since people often associate habits with the entire environment. Have separate places for work, and leisure and over time you become a product of this environment. 

# Craving
## Make it attractive 
It's easier to avoid temptation tham resist it. You can't resist a bad habit, but you can cut off the cue that causes it in it's source. It's the temptation that causes all habits. Dopamine spikes occur when you attain a reward but more so in anticipation of the reward. Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

Things are more attractive when you see other people doing it. Especially people who are powerful, or who you are close to.
Surround yourself with people who who have habits you want yourself. Join a culture where your desired behavior is normal and you already have something in common with the group. A study showed that when a chimpanzee who uses an effective way of cracking nuts, switches to a new group that uses a less effective way, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps... umm... yeah.

Highlight the benefits of a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. What good comes from arguing with strangers on reddit about the best routine to stay off social media applications like umm reddit? For good habits, change the way you look at them; instead of 'I have to work out', you can say 'I can workout to be stronger and more fit'.

# Response
## Make it easy.
Art and Fear - In two groups of film students, one group was told they'd be graded on number of photos submitted, and the other was to be graded on the quality of one picture that is to be submitted. It was found that the best pictures came from the first group, who took many photos trying different measures, rather than the group who speculated about perfection. Similarly, I often find myself focused on figuring the best approach that I never get around to taking action. Voltaire said that "Best is the enemy of the good", and Ryan Howard *humorously* said "I'm such a perfectionist that I'd rather not do it at all, than do a crappy version". It feels nice to know that we are thinking about progress, because the thoughts are free of risk. However, to master most things, the key is to start with repetition and grow with feedback, not perfection. Habits are formed through repetition, and the best way to ensure repetition is to make the habits easy. 

Goldilocks rule is to keep your habits at a manageable difficulty, not too hard or not too easy. Conventional motivation says maybe if you really wanted it, you'd do it. But the truth is that our only motivation, at most times, is to do what is convenient. Maybe a smarter strategy would be to reduce the friction that occurs with good habits.
Habits aren't always the action, but rather the entry point. They are the walk you take to the gym, not the workout itself. When you start a new habit, make sure the first two minutes are easy; you have to standardise before you can optimize. You can use habit shaping to create phases that can be broken down. I need to be healthy and strong -> I need to exercise and eat healthy regularly -> exercise 4 times a week and have a fruit everyday -> exercise for half an hour a day and nuts every day -> exercise for 15 mins -> stand up and do some stretching.

# Reward
## Make it satisfying 
The human brain usually works in one way : what is immediately rewarded will be repeated, what is not will be punished; with no regard for longer term consequences. The road less travelled, in this case, is the road of delayed gratification. It makes sense in his case to find an immediate reward for your good habits. One idea is to keep a tab towards something you want to buy. Everytime you read an investment article, or pass an opportunity to open reddit, put a small amount in that tab. You have a reward for not opening it now. 

The difference between successful people and others is showing up on bad days, and showing up despite boredom. There's no secret for unlimited motivation or an endless reserve of passion among successful people. To be successful, you can't let life get in the way, can't let your mood or other factors that change by the day affect something that you've been working towards for years.
You can't be a fair weather meditator. The greatest threat to my success is not failure, but rather boredom. I seek novelty even when things are working well for me. What other option do I have now, but to fall in love with boredom. 

Master the art of showing up. Track your habits on a daily basis, it doesn't matter if your did the task well or not, what matters initially is that you did it. It's important to never miss twice. Missing one day is fine, but not twice. Consistency is greater than perfection. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. 

The fact that you're being consistent shows growth.
